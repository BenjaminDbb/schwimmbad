Implementations of four different types of processing pools:

    - MPIPool: An MPI pool borrowed from ``emcee``. This pool passes Python
      objects back and forth to the workers and communicates once per task.

    - MPIOptimizedPool: An attempt at an optimized version of the MPI pool,
      specifically for passing arrays of numpy floats. If the length of the
      array passed to the ``map`` method is larger than the number of processes,
      the iterable is passed in chunks, which are processed *serially* on each
      processor. This minimizes back-and-forth communication and should increase
      the speed a bit.

    - MultiPool: A multiprocessing for local parallelization, borrowed from
      ``emcee``

    - SerialPool: A serial pool, which uses the built-in ``map`` function
